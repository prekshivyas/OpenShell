# run-openclaw-forward-test.ps1 - OpenClaw-over-MXC test (both backends).
#
# Proves the full path this package exists to demonstrate:
#   gateway -> MXC driver -> ProcessContainer OR isolation_session sandbox
#     (neither has an in-sandbox supervisor process; ProcessContainer also
#     has no inbound network capability at all)
#     -> openshell-supervisor-relay launches OpenClaw's gateway inside it
#     -> `openshell forward service --target-port 18889` opens a per-request,
#        on-demand WebSocket relay (bound fresh for this call, torn down when
#        it ends -- there is no always-on bridge)
#     -> a real OpenClaw client (`openclaw gateway health`) on the HOST,
#        talking through that forwarded port, authenticates and gets a real
#        response.
#
# -Backend selects which MXC backend to exercise (default: process_container).
# Both go through the exact same dynamic-forward/control-channel code path in
# the driver -- spawner wrapping is computed before the backend branch, so
# nothing about openshell-supervisor-relay or the relay protocol differs.
# What DOES differ is the config: isolation_session merges the sandbox env onto the
# full host environment (no pc_minimal_env / LOCALAPPDATA workaround needed)
# and ignores ProcessContainer-only fields like pc_capabilities entirely --
# see mxc-openclaw-isolation.toml's own comments.
#
# This test brings its OWN OpenClaw install (node.exe + the openclaw npm
# package) rather than shipping one: point -NodeExePath and
# -OpenClawInstallDir at your existing install. The AppContainer here can
# only read paths under share_dir, so this script STAGES (copies) your
# node.exe, the openclaw package, and this package's own
# openclaw-capture.mjs / openshell-supervisor-relay.exe into share_dir before
# creating the sandbox -- see the "Stage artifacts" step below. The OpenClaw
# package can be large (native-addon plugins etc.); the copy uses robocopy
# and only re-copies changed files on a rerun.
#
# Run from inside the package folder (gateway + cli + openshell-supervisor-
# relay.exe + mxc-openclaw-gateway.toml + openclaw-gateway.yaml +
# openclaw-capture.mjs + this script all sit together):

What PASS means: the gateway created a sandbox on the $Backend backend (no
in-sandbox supervisor process; ProcessContainer also has no inbound network
capability at all); openshell-supervisor-relay launched OpenClaw's gateway
inside it via the driver's control channel;
`openshell forward service` opened a fresh, on-demand WebSocket relay for
this one call (nothing pre-declared beyond the startup liveness port); and a
REAL OpenClaw client running on this host, talking only through that
forwarded port, authenticated with a token and got back a real 'ok: true'
health response. The egress proof also required an allowed HTTPS request to
pass through the OpenShell proxy while a denied host and direct Internet
bypass were blocked. Host loopback remains broadly reachable because dynamic
forwarding uses ephemeral loopback ports.
